I work on RL, LLMs, and their interactions at [Cohere](https://www.cohere.com). Previously, I was a research scientist at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com), where I focused on using transformers for combinatorial optimization and discrete problems. I hold a Ph.D. in reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization from Inria/CNRS, where I was part of the SequeL/ScooL team under the supervision of [P. Preux](https://philippe-preux.github.io).
