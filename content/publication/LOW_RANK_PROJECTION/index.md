abstract = """In this work, we study the behavior of standard models for community detection under spectral manipulations. Through various ablation experiments, we evaluate the impact of bandpass filtering on the performance of a GCN: we empirically show that most of the necessary and used information for nodes classification is contained in the low-frequency domain, and thus contrary to images, high frequencies are less crucial to community detection. In particular, it is sometimes possible to obtain accuracies at a state-of-the-art level with simple classifiers that rely only on a few low frequencies."""
